This program is best operated in GitHub Codespaces, but when there is no alternative, use RStudio. Requirement libraries are "ggplot", "rnaturalearth", "sf", and "wbstats", all for the R script. For the Python script, again, try to use GitHub Codespaces, but when not possible, use the latest version of Python, accessible at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Using the built in IDLE that comes with Python should suffise. In addition, make sure to install "imageio" library, for image processing. In addition, the Animator script contains a file path, which will work perfectly if the repository is forked, and GitHub Codespaces is used. However, if running on a local machine, please ensure to change the file path to match your local folder of images.
